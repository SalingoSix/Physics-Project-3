Project by Alex Medos

Project should run in Debug mode, x86 configuration

Hitting space switches balls, and you control the coloured one.
Use one of the larger ones to best interact with the soft body.

On line 326 in the main, you can change the dimensions of the soft body.
Try not to make it too long though, or it'll generate through the right wall.

Controls:

WASD - Moves camera in cardinal directions

Mouse - Look around (like an FPS)

Space - Changes the selected sphere. Camera focuses on the selected sphere,
	and it's the only sphere in the scene that will have colour

Enter - Switch soft body rendering (nodes/solid mesh)

Arrow Keys - Move the selected ball in a cardinal direction (independant of camera position)

Thanks, and have fun.
